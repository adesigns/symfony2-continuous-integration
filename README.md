Continuous Integration with Symfony2 and Git
===============================

The goal of this project is to be able to deploy a Symfony2 application with nothing more than git hooks.  

Inspired from capifony, I wanted to be able to seamlessly deploy my applications without needing to install
other tools(ruby, capistrano, etc).  With a little bash scripting, I found this to be rather easy.
